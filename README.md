# Stablecoin Analysis

This repository is part of my **Web3 Market Research Portfolio**.  
It is intended to showcase applied use cases for digital assets, with a specific focus on **stablecoins**.

## About This Notebook
The notebook explores:
- Stablecoin transaction volumes vs. traditional payment processors (Visa, Mastercard, AmEx).
- Market share comparisons across chains.
- Yield analysis across protocols.
- Stablecoin turnover and velocity trends.
- Deposit and adoption patterns.

The included visualizations highlight **how stablecoins have surpassed Visa & Mastercard in annual transaction value in 2024** (based on ARK Investment data).

## Why This Matters
Stablecoins are one of the fastest-growing segments in digital assets and payments, and this notebook demonstrates data-driven insights that could inform:
- **Recruiters & hiring managers**: My ability to analyze and present Web3 financial data in a clear, business-oriented way.
- **Web3 researchers & practitioners**: Practical methods for analyzing blockchain adoption metrics.
- **General audience**: Understanding how digital currencies compare to traditional finance rails.
